#Ways You Can Contribute (iOS)
We would love any help you can give us on the application. There are always ways you can contribute!

- Front-end Developers:
  - Either using Sketch or similar design tool, design the look and layout of the app, including the app icon. Please strictly follow [Apple's Design Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/userexperience/conceptual/mobilehig/).
  - Using Xcode's storyboard or nib, implement a custom design or custom control. Even programmatically generated views will be accepted if they work nicely with everything else. Swift or Objective-C is welcome.
- Back-end Developers:
  - Using Core Data, help with local storage of everything in order to keep track of lists, dates, favorites, etc.
  - Also start thinking of a back end service to use to gather data for our own analytics. Ex: [Parse](https://parse.com/)
- Food Researchers:
 - Research is a large part of our app. We need help with fact checking such as typical food expiration, seasonal foods, and recipes.
